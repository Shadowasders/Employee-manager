  ## Project Description
  This project allows for management of multiple employees using a command line interface. Users can add employees to their own database, assign them managers, roles, salaries, and departments 

  ## Installation
  Download the code, use npm i to install the dependancies, then run the app with node server

  ## Usage
  Use it to keep track of your employees, and keep yourself orginized!

  ## How to Contribute
  Some functions of the app need work, for a future update I'd like to be able to see employees by role, or by department, as well as delete departments, roles, and employees!

  ## Testing
  Download it and try anything. Some categories for employees only accept certain types of data, ie a salary must be a number, next steps would be to clarify that, and in case of an error,  return to function start
